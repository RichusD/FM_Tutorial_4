## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- **View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size**
-- Done...ish. For some reason, my main card refuses to resize any larger than the current version, which was designed for mobile. It's still legible on desktop size, but not what I intended.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-- Done. I also managed to set things up to avoid the hover state continuing to be applied once an item is selected.
- Select and submit a number rating
-- Done.
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
-- Done. I also added a button to allow the user to rate again, just for... fun?

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (Vanilla)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript


### Continued development

In the future I'll be looking to:
- Try out and learn CSS grid. It could've been helpful in this and previous tutorials, but I have no idea.
- Focus more on responsiveness. I could've fixed the issue with the card not resizing early on in the process where there wasn't as much in teh project that could be causing it.
